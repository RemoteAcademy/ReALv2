How To Run (Linux):

1. Open a terminal window in the Webapp folder, or navigate to that folder in the terminal
2. Type "php -S localhost:8000" (no quotes, you may need to install php via "sudo apt install php" first)
3. In any web browser, type this in as the URL: 127.0.0.1:8000

In either case, to run the server on your machine such that it can be accessed by a different (client) machine, use "php -S 0.0.0.0:80" instead of "php -S localhost:8000". Then, in a web browser on a client machine, type in the IP address of the server with :80 appended as the URL to connect to the server.

That's it!
